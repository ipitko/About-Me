# About-Me

Hi! I'm Iiris, a MSc student in Life Science Technologies at Aalto University.
  - My current interests include bioinformatics, machine learning techniques and how those can be utilized for bioinformatics purposes, health tech innovations, and entrepreneurship.
  - My main programming languages are Python and R (data analysis and visualization, machine learning, statistics), but I'm also familiar with Java and SQL (data structures and algorithms). I have done a lot of course work and some projects in all of these languages, that you can find from my repositories.
  - My other passions include ringette, sports, and nature.
